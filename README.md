•	Lowest spending score age group? 
•	Do the top earners in each gender display similar spending habits?
2.	Correlational
•	Do monthly visits correlate with higher spending? If not, then find out which product has the lowest, and discuss why. 
•	Is age positively or negatively correlated with spending?
3.	Important: Growth potential 
•	Are there customers with high income but low spending? For which products? Upsell opportunity? 
•	Which products are associated with higher spending segments?
