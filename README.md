# Customer-Segmentation-Data
Customer Segmentation: Identifying high-value customer behaviour and growth opportunities.
This dataset contains 350 customer records with a mix of numerical and categorical features. It includes demographics, spending behavior, and product preferences, making it suitable for unsupervised learning and customer segmentation tasks.
Key Questions this analysis will attempt to answer: 
1.	Demographics
•	Income disparity between genders (who earns more and who spends more)
•	Income disparity between ages (who earns and who spends more)
•	Lowest spending score age group? 
•	Do the top earners in each gender display similar spending habits?
2.	Correlational
•	Do monthly visits correlate with higher spending? If not, then find out which product has the lowest, and discuss why. 
•	Is age positively or negatively correlated with spending?
3.	Important: Growth potential 
•	Are there customers with high income but low spending? For which products? Upsell opportunity? 
•	Which products are associated with higher spending segments?
•	Which demographic can have the highest potential return if targetted for ads and loyalty programs?
